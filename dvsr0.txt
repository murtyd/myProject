NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday reportedly warned BJP MPs who don't attend Parliament that they may not get to contest the next Lok Sabha polls if they persist with the habit.

Addressing the Bharatiya Janata Party's parliamentary party meeting in New Delhi, PM Modi also praised Amit Shah on completing three years as the BJP President and on being elected to the Rajya Sabha, saying he had brought back the culture of hard work known in the Jan Sangh days.

Informed sources said PM Modi told the meeting that the party was bigger than any individual and asked why MPs should be reminded about the need to attend Parliament.

According to sources, PM Modi said there should not be any need to issue whips to ensure their attendance.

"What are you and me? The party is everything... You do what you want to, I will see in 2019," PM Modi was quoted as saying, in apparent hints that they may be denied nomination in the next election.

PM Modi also reminded the members that Amit Shah will be in Parliament now and they should be regular in attending the sittings.
